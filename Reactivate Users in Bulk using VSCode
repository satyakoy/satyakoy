Intro
Some days ago, I had to create a Salesforce sandbox where several members of the project teams will be able to make updates.
I was about to manually update one by one all users to remove the .invalid at the end of their email, then I remembered that such operation is pretty boring to perform everytime on each sandbox, and Iâ€™m not a fan of boring repetitive operations.
So why not using an hour to create a new sfdx-hardis command that would do that with a few clicks and 10 seconds ?
And command sfdx hardis:org:user:activateinvalid was born ðŸ¤“
Usage
Please follow sfdx-hardis installation instructions , launch Visual Studio Code in an empty folder (or a sfdx project if you have one), then open sfdx-hardis extension (in the left pane).
Then click on command Operations -> Activate .invalid user emails in sandbox

If you do not have a selected Salesforce org, just login in your web browser as requested.
You now have the choice between setting valid emails to:
All users (with a .invalid email)
Users assigned to a list a profile(s)
Users selected one by one
